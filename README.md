# ReCoopr

A critical part of raising capital to produce a theatrical production, is the recoupment chart. This is an outline of the number of weeks a show has to run for and at what percentage of tickets sold in order to repay its capitalization to its investors. The purpose of ReCoopr is to help make recoupment analysis easier. In this tool, you can select from 35 different broadway theaters and create seat maps with customizable pricing so that you can project in a given pricing scenario (think “weekday matinees”, “holidays”, etc) the gross potential of ticket sales. Users can then play with the pricing model to further refine their ticket trajectory.
